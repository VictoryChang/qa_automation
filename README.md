# QA Automation

## Sprints
- Get familiar development lifecycle
  - Propose small mvps (where possible!)
- Get involved from the beginning
- Create a test plan (based on requirements/spec)
- Document test cases
- Create a scalable/reliable test design library
- Manually run test cases
- Code test cases
- Analyze test results
- Share test results
- Identify/report broken tests
- Add test cases to ci/cd pipeline

## On-going
- Add comprehensize coverage (where possible!)
- Keep up with QA tools (keep learning!)
- Identify and prioritize the tests for manual and automated testing
- Time-box exploratory testing for a specific feature
- Recommend improvements for test/software engineering practices
